Let me check the memory context.\n\nLooking back, there's a memory entry about Sahil Mulla related to a Network Security Monitoring System project from 2022–2023. The details include his work on session tracking, user management, key logging, and a secure workspace. Also, his contact info: phone +91 9152754549 and email sahilmulla9152@gmail.com. There's a feedback note mentioning a possible name discrepancy with 'Sahil M' in a podcast URL, but it's unclear if they're the same person.\n\nThe user might be asking about the Sahil Mulla mentioned in the document. Since the memory has structured facts about him, I should use that. The answer should summarize his project and note the name discrepancy. I need to avoid mentioning JSON and stick to the provided info. Also, check if there's enough info to answer directly. Yes, the memory has enough details to provide a concise answer without uncertainty.\n</think>\n\nSahil Mulla is associated with the development of a **Network Security Monitoring System** (2022–2023), which includes features like session tracking, user management, key logging, and a dedicated workspace for enhanced data security. Key details from the uploaded document include:\n\n- **Project Focus**: The system provides insights into user behavior and activity, ensuring efficient monitoring and security.\n- **Experience**: Worked on real-life web applications, gaining expertise in **front-end and back-end development**.\n- **Contact Information**: \n  - Phone: +91 9152754549\n  - Email: sahilmulla9152@gmail.com\n\nThe document does not provide additional personal details beyond his professional work on the security system and IT solutions.\n\n--- Debug state keys ---\n ['user_input', 'reflections', 'final', 'log']\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":44},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# =======================\n# Chat Loop for Agent\n# =======================\ndef chat_loop():\n    print(\"🤖 Agent ready!
